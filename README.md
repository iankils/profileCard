# Project: Modern Profile Card with HTML & CSS  

## Objective  

Create a modern, responsive profile card using HTML and CSS that showcases your creativity, design skills, and understanding of modern web techniques.
You’ll use CSS animations, transitions, and hover effects to bring your card to life.

## Submission
1. Upload both files (index.html and styles.css) to GitHub Classroom.
2. Create a live site with your IDE, upload link to Jupiter.

## Requirements
1. Structure (HTML)
- Create a single HTML file (index.html).
- Include:
  - A container for your card.
  - A profile image.
  - Your name and a short title (e.g., “Web Developer”).
  - A short description or bio (2–3 sentences).
  - Social media icons or buttons (use Font Awesome or simple text links).
2. Styling (CSS)
- Create a separate CSS file (styles.css).
- Use flexbox or CSS grid to center your card on the page.
- Include the following:
  - A modern color scheme (think gradients, pastels, or dark mode).
  - Rounded corners and drop shadows for a modern feel.
  - Hover effects on the card and social links (e.g., glow, scale, color change).
  - A smooth transition (e.g., transition: all 0.3s ease;).
  - An animation (e.g., fade in, slide up, or card flip).

## Bonus Ideas
- Add a card flip animation showing contact info on the back.
- Use a hover gradient background.
- Add CSS variables for easy color theme changes.
- Make it responsive (works on mobile and desktop).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Semantic HTML
- CSS layout (Flexbox/Grid)
- Transitions & animations
- Responsive design
- Creativity in UI styling
